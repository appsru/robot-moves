USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Download zip, extract it and open index.html in the browser.
  * robot.html uses left-right arrows to direct Robo
    * left arrow points robo left and up
    * right arrow points robo right and down
    * 360 rotation added but was buggy and counter intuative so limits to left/right arrows were placed
   
  * robot1.html uses left-right-up-down arrows to direct Robo


It has been created according to the specs but with a few additions to make it a little bit more entertaining.
